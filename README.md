# GunksAlert
GunksAlert is a web app that alerts climbers when conditions are looking promising in various climbing desitinations. It's purpose is to provide a heads up to climbers when conditions are looking good during the months of the year when climbing is generally "out of season". For instance, from December through about April every year climbing outdoors in Vermont is typically not happening. During these months, a Vermont climber could subscribe to GunksAlert to receive a text message when there has been a long spell of dry, sunny weather and a warm forecast in New Paltz, NY for the coming weekend.

> **Heads up!** Currently in development. See the [design doc](./docs/design.md) for details on the plan.
